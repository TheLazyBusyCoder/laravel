// FILE'S 


OPERATIONS
	R -> open the file to read only , place the pointer at the begning of the file.
	r+ -> reading and writing , pointer at the begning.
	w -> writing only , place the file pointer at the beginning if file is not present it will create it.
	w+ -> reading and writing 
	A -> open for writing only , file pointer at the end.
	a+ -> reading and writing

FILE FUNCTIONS:
	$file = fopen("filename.txt" , "r");
	fclose($fp);					// close the file.
	fread($fp , 10); 				// reades character.  
	fwrite($fp , "hello");  		// writing
	fgetc($fp); 						// read one character , returns false if reachead end of file.
	fgets(); 		// read set of characters , 1p = file pointer , 2p = length 
		- will stop reading when new line occured.
		- end of file is reached
		- specified number of bytes has been read.

	fputs(); // alias for fwrite();
	file('location of file');  // return entire contents of file.  automatically opens , reads , anclose the file.
	readfile(); // prints content of file without having a call to fopen();

	fseek(); 
		- 1p = $fp, 2p offset (number of bytes to move the pointer +ve forward -ve backword
				3p = SEEK_SET -> set the offset from the beginnig of the file. 
						SEEK_CUR -> set the offset  from the current position 
						SEEK_END -> set from the end of file
		- used to move the file pointer. 
		- fseek($fp , 10 , SEEK_SET);

	ftell($fp); // returns the current pointer position.
	rewind($fp); // reset the file pointer position to the beggning of the file.
	file_exists('path/file.txt'); // returns true if file is there;
	file_size($fp); // returns file size in bytes
	fileatime('file.txt'); // returns last access time for a file
	filectime(); 	// returns last changed time
	filemtime(); 
	fileowner(); return the user id of the owner of file.

	basename(); // 1p file name as an argument and separate the filename from tis directory path.
	copy('source' , 'destination'); 	// 
	rename('oldname' , 'newname');
	unlink(); // deleting a file.
	is_file(); // true if given name is file.
